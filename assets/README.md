The pizza in the pizzabox in the header should increase in size and spin when you hover over it.

The pizza in the header should be in 3D - we have incorporated a zipfile with assets fot the design but if you have ideas or another way of doing it we are open to suggestions.

We are using the same pictures on the productcard from unsplashed at the moment but are going to use our own pictures later.

Main picture on each screensize should be 100vh and should fade in
The quote should appear from the left side of the screen
